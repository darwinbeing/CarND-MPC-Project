\section{Vehicle Model}

\subsection{Kinematic Bicycle Model}
Kinematic models are simplifications of dynamic models that ignore tire forces, gravity, and mass.
This simplification reduces the accuracy of the models, but it also makes them more tractable.
At low and moderate speeds, kinematic models often approximate the actual vehicle dynamics.
The vehicle model is described by

\begin{equation}\label{eq:VehicleModel}
\begin{bmatrix}
x_{t+1}\\
y_{t+1}
\end{bmatrix} = f(x_t, u_t)
\end{equation}
where $f(x_t, u_t)$ is the vehicle dynamic state update equation. The vectors $x_t$ and $u_t$ collect the states and inputs of the vehicle at time $t$
\begin{subequations}\label{eq:StateInputVector}
\begin{align}
x_t &= [x_t ~ y_t ~\psi_t ~ v_t ~ cte_t ~ e_{\psi_t} ]\\
u_t &= [\delta_t ~ a_t ]
\end{align}
\end{subequations}
where $cte_t$ represents the distance travelled along the center-line of the road, $e_{\psi_t}$ the heading angle error between the vehicle and the path. $x_t$, $y_t$ and ${\psi}_{t}$ are the vehicle longitudinal position, lateral position and yaw angle, respectively. The inputs are the longitudinal acceleration $a_t$ and the steering angle $\delta_t$.

We've now defined the state, actuators and how the state changes over time based on the previous state and current actuator inputs.

Here defines update state as  follows:
\begin{subequations}\label{eq:StateUpdate}
\begin{align}
x_{t+1} &= x_t + v_t * \cos({\psi}_t) * dt\\
y_{t+1} &= y_t + v_t * \sin({\psi}_t) * dt\\
\psi_{t+1} &= \psi_t + \frac{v_t}{L_f} * \delta_t * dt\\
v_{t+1} &= v_t + a_t * dt\\
% cte_{t+1} &= \underbrace{f(x_t) - y_t}_{\text{being current cross track error}} + v_t * \sin(e_{\psi_t}) * dt\\
cte_{t+1} &= \explain{f(x_t) - y_t}{cross track error} + v_t * \sin(e_{\psi_t}) * dt\\
e_{\psi_{t+1}} &= \explain{\psi_t - {\psi}_{des_t}}{orientation error} + \frac{v_t}{L_f} * \delta_t * dt
\end{align}
\end{subequations}
